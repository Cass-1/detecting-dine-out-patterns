# Detecting Dine-Out Patterns

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to analyze patterns in restaurant visits by combining two datasets:
one containing restaurant locations and the other capturing an individualâ€™s location data. The
objective is to determine if the individual has visited any of the restaurants and to calculate the
duration of each potential visit.

## Task:

- Combine the restaurant location dataset with the individual's location data.
- Define criteria for what constitutes a "visit," including minimum and maximum time
  spans.
- Identify restaurant visits based on the combined data and defined visit parameters.
- Calculate the duration of each visit.
- Analyze and report on dine-out patterns based on the results.
